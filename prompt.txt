Build a Python program that generates an optimal class schedule for a dance studio. The data comes from an Excel file with three sheets:
1. classes: contains class_name, style, level, age_start, age_end, duration (in hours), preferred_days, preferred_time_ranges, preferred_rooms, preferred_teachers
2. teachers: contains teacher_name, availability
3. rooms: contains room_name, availability, and group (to define rooms with accordion walls that cannot be used simultaneously)

The program should:
1. Load the data from the Excel file
2. Break the day into 15-minute time slots (e.g., 15:15 to 21:00)
3. Assign each class a teacher, room, day, and start time, respecting:
- Class duration and time preference windows
- Room and teacher availability
- Room group exclusivity (e.g., if Room 1+2 is used, Room 1 and 2 cannot be used at the same time)
- Only assign classes to one of their preferred rooms and teachers
- Output the final schedule to an Excel or CSV file

Use the Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver to enforce constraints and find a feasible schedule. Organize the code into clear functions or modules for:
- Data loading
- Constraint modeling
- Solving
- Output formatting
